## Routing Algorithms

### Running
1. Go to the directory where the files are
2. In terminal type 
<pre>python routing.py --alg [algorithm to use ("flooding", "dv", "fl")]</pre>
3. After that the program will ask for a JID and PASSWORD

#### For Link State Algorithm
1. Go to the directory where the files are
2. Make sure the topology and name files are named topo.txt and names.txt
3. In terminal type 
<pre>python link.py --alg link</pre>
4. After that the program will ask for a JID and PASSWORD

### Features
* Use different routing algorithms to communicate in a network
* Send/receive messages using the optimal path
